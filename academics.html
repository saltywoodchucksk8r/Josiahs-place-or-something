    <p>I attended Inglewood high school from 2021 till 2022 my experince at this high school was something I could never
        forget. My freshman year I joined band and had an amazing experince. I got to go to a
        jennifer lopez concert for free at the dodgers stadium and I was able to learn how to play my first instrument.

    Im currently attending fresno high school, Ive been attending since my sophomore
    year 2022 and I plan on graduating 2025. I moved to fresno 2022 with my mom and
    ive had alot of fun since. I've been in the fresno high school band since my
    sophomore year and I plan on staying in the band until I graduate. In the fresno
    high band I learned 3 more instruments outside of the trombone. The other
    instruments I learned how to play are the baritone, bass trombone, and cymbals.
    To find out how I got it check this link out <a href="more-abt-me.html">here</a>

        I am also attending this school that goes by the acronym of CART which stands
        for Center for Advanced Research and Technology. This school is as you can probably
        guess is a school for specialized learning for some specific things like if you
        want to learn about forensics or psychology or many other things. The class
        I chose and that I'm currently enrolled in is called web applications or web
        app for short. Web app has been one of my favorite and most challenging classes
        that I have ever taken. In my opinion I think that this class has taught me
        more than I've learned in any other subject besides band. When you enroll in
        this class it first starts off as some fun team building activities to not
        only get to know your peers in your class but to know people in 2 of the other
        classes. Then slowly but surely you get introduced to coding languages first
        HTML then CSS and after that Javascript. In between that we did learn alot
        about other coding languages but these were the ones we use in this class.
