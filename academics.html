    <p>I attended Inglewood high school from 2021 till 2022 my experince at this high school was something I could never forget. My freshman year I joined band and had an amazing experince. I got to go to a 
        jennifer lopez concert for free at the dodgers stadium and I was able to learn how to play my first instrument.

    Im currently attending fresno high school, Ive been attending since my sophomore
     year 2022 and I plan on graduating 2025. I moved to fresno 2022 with my mom and 
     ive had alot of fun since. I've been in the fresno high school band since my 
     sophomore year and I plan on staying in the band until I graduate. In the fresno
      high band I learned 3 more instruments outside of the trombone. The other 
      instruments I learned how to play are the baritone, bass trombone, and cymbals.
